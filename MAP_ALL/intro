This is a (work in progress) sort of universal macro that does multiple map making in Julia of ENZO simulations, for the moment:

- projected field quantities
- synchrotron radio emission from shocks
- HI emission 

It can run 
- in serial, by cutting the volume into multiple HDF5 blocks;
- in parallel, by distributing the map making to different cores;
- in mixed parallel way (suitable for very large runs), by distributing tasks to different cores and allowing each of them to cut the volume in multiple HDF5 blocks.
