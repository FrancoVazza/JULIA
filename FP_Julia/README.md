Fokker planck solution for tracer particles in Julia.
The code assumes the existence of ENZO (or in general, grid-like) data to inject and advect passive tracers, and it solves for their energy evolution (including injection, re-acceleration by shocks and radiative/collisional losses) in a different step.
